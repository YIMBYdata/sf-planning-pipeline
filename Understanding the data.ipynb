There are a bunch of permits and project proposals related to AT&T and T-mobile wanting to replace equipment at the top of the building.  In 2015, there was a proposal to renovate the building.  It starts out as a PRV (project review meeting), followed by a PRJ (project profile).  A year later they file a PTA (permit to alter), which is approved.  However, the status of the project is marked as \"under review\" which might mean they still haven't gotten permission.\n",
